==========
```golang
// package serveme implements a dial function and a net.Listener that allow
// a client and server to communicate by having the server contact the client
// rather than the other way around. This is handy in situations where the
// client is reachable using an IP and port, but the server isn't (for example
// if the server is behind an impenetrable NAT).
//
// For this to work, the client and server must be able to communicate with each
// other via a signaling channel. When the client wants to connect to the
// server, it sends a message with the necessary connection information to the
// server, which then connects to the client.
//
// Right now, serveme only supports TCP.
```
